Work with a partner. Choose one project. If you have an idea for a
different project, speak to the professor first.

If you already know someone you want to work with, and s/he wants to
work with you, BOTH students should send an email to Fanchao stating
this. Otherwise we will assign you a partner. If you really want to
work alone (not recommended), tell us that.

Due: Friday May 18 (any time of day). Submit all materials including a
README file, into the SVN account of ONE of the partners. The README
file should contain a description of the problem you worked on, the
structure of your implementation (how is it broken up into functions
and what does each do?), what you were able to specify about it, and
what you were able to prove (or not prove). A Makefile should be
included to run all of the verification tasks.

Tic tac toe

Design a simple tic-tac-toe game in C in which a user plays the
computer. The computer accepts keyboard input specifying the square
the user wants to mark next. It returns the computer's next move and a
print-out of the current state of the game: a grid marked with Xs and
Os. At the end, the computer says who wins (or that there is a tie).

Some things to prove:
  - the computer's move is valid
  - the computer will reject an invalid move from the user
  - the final result reported by the computer is correct (e.g., if
  it says the user won, then the user really did win)
  - other goals as needed
  - the ultimate goal: the computer can never lose (i.e., the worst
  it will do is tie)
